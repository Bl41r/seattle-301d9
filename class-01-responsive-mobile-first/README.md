# Class 1 - Mobile-First / Responsive Design and SMACSS

Let's develop some mobile/responsive super-powers!

## Pair assignments

Throughout this course, you'll have a structured way to do "pair programming" with your classmates. You will have the opportunity to work with a number of your classmates, benefiting from their backgrounds and perspectives, whether it's technical or otherwise.

With a pair, make the blog responsive, so it hides the main navigation menu under a "Hamburger" link on small screens, and unfurls to a row of tab-like links on larger screens.

Then, see how you can apply these same ideas in your portfolio!
